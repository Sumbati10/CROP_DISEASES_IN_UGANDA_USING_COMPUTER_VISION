Transfer Learning)
Build and train a convolutional neural network to classify images into five classes
Improve the model by using Transfer Learning and adapting a pre-trained image classification model
Identify model overfitting.
Evaluate model performance using k-fold cross-validation
Utilize Callbacks like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping to optimize training
